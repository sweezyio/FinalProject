# Final Project for CIS 231
This repository contains my final project for my CIS 231: Computer Programming Principles II class. 

## Description
The assignment was to make a unique program using JavaFX that utilized features of the library that were covered in class. I decided to make a typing speed test that would allow you to test your typing speed on a variety of lengths of text. 

## Possible Imrpovements
- Instead of just random words, include popular stories or phrases to make the test more similar to real typing conditions.
- Add an option to see how many words you can type in a given amount of time, instead of just the other way around.
- Add a leaderboard
	- A global leaderboard that syncs with a server

A demo of this project is available [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYGeBydJB-w).
